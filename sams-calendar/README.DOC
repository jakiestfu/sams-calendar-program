Dere Samuel.....I found most of this stuff on an old floppy disc.
Did a little bit of repair work but not all. Primarily you need to adjust
and/or replace data in the data files which no longer pertain  to the
current time frame. It's a beautiful little program that is impossible to
figure out why it works...all I know is that it does. At least until the end of the millenium, when the left$ of the Date$ turn
to zeroes...probably have to enter the year date manually....or something.
