# sams-calendar-program
My Grandfather on my mothers side was an electricion. His name was Sam. Although that was his vocation, he loved to play with puzzles and write code. By the time I was old enough to get to know him, he was in a late stage of Alzheimers. He passed and I only ever heard stories of his code.

One day, my Mother found these floppy disks and gifted them to me recently. I couldn't wait to see what these files contained! Some highlights include:

* Files dating back to 1979 and modified as late as 1993, the year after I was born.
* Visual Basic scripts. Looks like he not only wrote a calendar program, but a couple other things such as
  * Lotto Number Generators
  * ? Baseball
  * ? Billboard
  * ? Address Book
* Calendar Program
* Contacts and people (mostly all deceased relatives of mine, but friends too!)
* A letter from a mysterious person regarding this calendar program.
